# Lucky Roulette Game Implementation

## Overview
The Lucky Roulette game is a fully functional minigame integrated into the DogEatDog app. It features an animated roulette wheel with various rewards, Firebase integration for persistence, and a complete user experience with statistics tracking.

## Features

### ðŸŽ° Game Mechanics
- **8 Different Segments**: Coins, Experience, Daily Urinations, Territory Radius, and Jackpot
- **Probability-Based Rewards**: Each segment has different probability weights
- **Animated Wheel**: Smooth spinning animation using React Native Reanimated
- **Cost System**: 10 coins per spin with 1 free daily spin
- **Progressive Rewards**: Better rewards for consecutive wins

### ðŸŽ¯ Rewards System
- **Coins**: 10, 25, 50 coins
- **Experience**: 50, 100 XP
- **Daily Urinations**: +1 daily pee allowance
- **Territory Radius**: +5m territory marking radius
- **Jackpot**: 300 coins (100 Ã— 3 multiplier)

### ðŸ“Š Statistics & History
- Total spins count
- Best win tracking
- Consecutive wins streak
- Game history with timestamps
- Average winnings calculation

### ðŸ”¥ Firebase Integration
- **User Stats**: Stored in `user_roulette_stats` collection
- **Game History**: Stored in `roulette_games` collection
- **Real-time Sync**: Stats update immediately after spins
- **Daily Reset**: Automatic free spin reset at midnight

### Key Components

#### RouletteWheel
- Uses React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- 8 segments with different colors and rewards
- Physics-based spinning with deceleration
- Pointer indicator for result

#### RouletteControls
- Animated spin button with haptic feedback
- Real-time stats display
- Cost calculation (free vs paid spins)
- User feedback for insufficient funds

#### RouletteHistory
- Scrollable list of recent spins
- Time-ago formatting
- Color-coded rewards by value
- Win streak tracking

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Manages game state, stats, and history
- **Firebase Sync**: Real-time updates to Firestore
- **Game Store Integration**: Rewards automatically applied to main game

## Business Logic

### Probability System
```typescript
const segments = [
  { id: 'coins-small', probability: 0.25 },    // 25% chance
  { id: 'coins-medium', probability: 0.20 },   // 20% chance
  { id: 'experience', probability: 0.20 },     // 20% chance
  { id: 'urinations', probability: 0.15 },     // 15% chance
  { id: 'radius', probability: 0.10 },         // 10% chance
  { id: 'jackpot', probability: 0.05 },        // 5% chance
  { id: 'coins-large', probability: 0.03 },    // 3% chance
  { id: 'experience-large', probability: 0.02 }, // 2% chance
];
```

### Cost System
- **Free Spins**: 1 per day, resets at midnight
- **Paid Spins**: 10 coins each
- **Validation**: Checks user's coin balance before allowing spin

### Reward Application
- Coins: Added to player's coin balance
- Experience: Added to player's XP (with level-up logic)
- Daily Urinations: Increases max daily territory marking limit
- Territory Radius: Increases territory marking radius
- Jackpot: Large coin reward with multiplier

## User Experience

### Visual Design
- **Gradient Background**: Purple to pink gradient matching app theme
- **Animated Elements**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Color-coded Segments**: Each reward type has distinct colors
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Haptic Feedback
- **Spin Button**: Medium impact when pressed
- **Success**: Notification feedback when winning
- **Error**: Error feedback for insufficient funds

### Accessibility
- **Touch Targets**: Large, easy-to-tap buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear state indicators
- **Error Handling**: Descriptive error messages
- **Loading States**: Clear indication during spinning

## Integration Points

### Game Store
- Rewards automatically applied to main game state
- Coin balance updates immediately
- Experience points trigger level-up logic
- Territory radius affects marking gameplay

### Firebase
- **Authentication**: Requires logged-in user
- **Real-time Updates**: Stats sync across devices
- **Offline Support**: Local state with sync on reconnect
- **Data Persistence**: Game history and stats preserved

### Navigation
- Integrated into existing minigames section
- Back button navigation
- Deep linking support via Expo Router

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for spins and wins
- **Animations**: Particle effects for jackpots
